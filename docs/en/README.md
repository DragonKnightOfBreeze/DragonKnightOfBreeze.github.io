# The Great Library In The Wind Ruins

There is a tale that in the ancient ruins guarded by the nation of wind for generations,
localed a great library that does not seem to belong to this world.  
And the librarian of this pure and flawless library is a girl with long white hair and crimson eyes
wearing a dark windbreaker and a cocked hat that symbolizes the identity of charmer.
