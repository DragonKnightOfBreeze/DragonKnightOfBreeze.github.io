# The Great Library In The Wind Ruins

There is a tale that in the ancient ruins guarded by the nation of wind for generations,
localed a great library that does not seem to belong to this world.

Besides, the librarian of this pure and flawless library,
is a girl with long white hair and crimson eyes, wearing a dark windbreaker and a cocked hat,
which symbolizes the identity of utopian messenger.
